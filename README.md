# interhelm

Agent-as-operator runtime diagnostics for the [Interverse](https://github.com/mistakeknot/Demarch) plugin ecosystem.

## What

Teaches agents to observe and control running applications via diagnostic HTTP servers and CLI tools. Instead of taking screenshots, agents query structured JSON endpoints for runtime state — including UI state.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins install interhelm
```

## Core Patterns

| Pattern | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Health** | Structured pass/fail per subsystem |
| **Diff** | Snapshot state, take action, show what changed |
| **Assert** | Scriptable verification expressions |
| **Smoke Test** | End-to-end flow verification (executable contract) |

## UI Observability

The killer feature: `/diag/ui/state` returns semantic JSON describing what's on screen — active view, panel states, selections, form values. Agents verify CUJs without screenshots at near-zero token cost.

## Usage

The skills guide agents to scaffold a diagnostic server and CLI for your project:

1. **`runtime-diagnostics`** — Scaffolds the full diagnostic HTTP server with all patterns
2. **`smoke-test-design`** — Designs executable contracts between server and client
3. **`cuj-verification`** — Validates user journeys via structured state queries

## Templates

- `templates/rust-hyper/` — Rust diagnostic server skeleton (hyper)
- `templates/cli/` — Thin CLI client with formatters, watch mode, REPL

- **Standalone** — no intercore dependency
- **Framework-agnostic** — works with Tauri, Electron, web apps, CLI tools
- **Pattern plugin** — teaches the pattern, agents generate the implementation
